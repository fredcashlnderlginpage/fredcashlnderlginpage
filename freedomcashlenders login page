The best route to a debt consolidation loan is through a bank or other lending institution, such as a credit union or online debt consolidation lender. The idea is that you borrow enough to pay off multiple debts, and then repay the lender with one check. It’s simpler that juggling all those payments, because you’re dealing with one lender and one monthly payment.

Even if you have an established relationship with your bank, it pays to shop around for the best interest rate and get at least three quotes for comparison. Credit unions often have better rates than national banks because they are nonprofit and have a cooperative structure that prioritizes members’ needs.

When checking out online lenders, stick to reputable sites and read the fine print about interest amounts. More and more lenders are doing online applications, and though it may seem easier than a face-to-face meeting, be sure you have all your financial ducks in order.
