Before doing anything, check your credit reports and scores, and make sure everything is accurate. Credit reports and scores are the financial bible for lenders and a mistake could cost you thousands in interest rates.
When applying for a 0% interest rate introductory credit card, make sure you can pay it off before the interest rate kicks in, or you might have an even bigger problem.
If you consolidate your debt onto one credit card, avoid maxing out the card’s credit limit, because that harms your credit utilization ratio, the amount you owe versus your credit limit.
If you’re considering a secured loan from a bank or credit union, keep in mind that you’ll be putting up a valuable item (such as you car) as collateral. The risk: If you fail to make payments, you’ll lose the collateral. The same goes for home equity loans for debt consolidation – if you don’t make payments, you could lose your house.
